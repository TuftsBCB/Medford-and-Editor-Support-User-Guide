    abstract = "{Over the last decade, technological advancements have substantially decreased the
                    cost and time of obtaining large amounts of sequencing data. Paired with the
                    exponentially increased computing power, individual labs are now able to
                    sequence genomes or transcriptomes to investigate biological questions of
                    interest. This has led to a significant increase in available sequence data.
                    Although the bulk of data published in articles are stored in public sequence
                    databases, very often, only raw sequencing data are available; miscellaneous
                    data such as assembled transcriptomes, genome annotations etc. are not easily
                    obtainable through the same means. Here, we introduce our website (http://reefgenomics.org) that aims to centralize genomic and
                    transcriptomic data from marine organisms. Besides providing convenient means to
                    download sequences, we provide (where applicable) a genome browser to explore
                    available genomic features, and a BLAST interface to search through the hosted
                    sequences. Through the interface, multiple datasets can be queried
                    simultaneously, allowing for the retrieval of matching sequences from organisms
                    of interest. The minimalistic, no-frills interface reduces visual clutter,

Whereas public databases have served as vital repositories for nucleotide sequences, they do not accession all the metadata required for ecological or evolutionary analyses. GeOMe fills this need, providing a user-friendly, web-based interface for both data contributors and data recipients. The interface allows data contributors to create a customized yet standard-compliant spreadsheet that captures the temporal and geospatial context of each biosample. These metadata are then validated and permanently linked to archived genetic data stored in the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI’s) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) via unique persistent identifiers. By linking ecologically and evolutionarily relevant metadata with publicly archived sequence data in a structured manner, GeOMe sets a gold standard for data management in biodiversity science.},

Information of their genome structure and function is critical for understanding coral symbiosis and bleaching. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, genome draft assemblies of several Symbiodiniaceae species and diverse marine algal genomes have become publicly available but spread in multiple separate locations. Here, we present a Symbiodiniaceae and Algal Genomic Resource Database (SAGER), a user-friendly online repository for integrating existing genomic data of Symbiodiniaceae species and diverse marine algal gene sets from MMETSP and PhyloDB databases. Relevant algal data are included to facilitate comparative analyses. The database is freely accessible at http://sampgr.org.cn. It provides comprehensive tools for studying gene function, expression and comparative genomics, including search tools to identify gene information from Symbiodiniaceae species, and BLAST tool to find orthologs from marine algae and protists. Moreover, SAGER integrates transcriptome datasets derived from diverse culture conditions of corresponding Symbiodiniaceae species. SAGER was developed with the capacity to incorporate future Symbiodiniaceae and algal genome and transcriptome data, and will serve as an open-access and sustained platform providing genomic and molecular tools that can be conveniently used to study Symbiodiniaceae and other marine algae.Database URL: http://sampgr.org.cn}",

abstract="Reproducibility of research is critical for science. Computational biology research presents a significant challenge, given the need to track critical details, such as software version or genome draft iteration. Metadata research infrastructures, while greatly improved, often assume a level of programming skills in their user community, or rely on expert curators to ensure that key information is not lost. This paper introduces MEDFORD, a new human-readable, easily-editable and templatable metadata language for scientists to collocate all the details relevant to their experiments. We provide an overview of the underlying design principles, language, and current and planned support infrastructure for parsing and translating MEDFORD into other metadata formats. MEDFORD 0.9 has been specifically designed for the coral research community, with initial metadata generated from RNA-Seq analyses of coral transcriptomes and coral photo collections. Notably, the format is generally applicable and useful for many types of scientific metadata generated by non-computer science experts.",
